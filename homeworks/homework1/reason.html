            <p>The very first Macbook (Pro) was released in 2006. The Macbook Air wasn't released until 2008.
               Fact is that OS X is the best operating system for developers. In 2016's Stack Overflow Survey,
               when asked what the most used operating system is, OS X was at the top. Dmitri Zagidulin once said,
               "Go to a tech conference or developer event. Look around you . . . and just count the number of
               glowy Apple logos on those laptops" 
               (<a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/apple/why-programmers-think-mac-os-x-is-best-os-use-3638706/">2</a>).
               These days, it's pretty much guaranteed that most developers use Macs. Programmers love (1) the Unix based
               command line, (2) the combination of Unix and commercial software, (3) the build quality, and cross-platform compatibility.
               </p>
               <p>(1) For the last 15 years Apple's operating system has been built on top of Unix, the command
               line-OS that powers most of the world's filesystems and servers. Not even modern versions of Linux are certified Unix operating systems
               (fun fact: they're based on GNU instead of Linux). Jessica Su, a CS PhD student at Stanford syas, "The Unix shell is very
               important for a programmer. It lets you run programs in almost any language without using a specialized IDE. It's also important if you
               want a job at a tech company since many companies make their employees work on Unix-based systems"
               (<a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/apple/why-programmers-think-mac-os-x-is-best-os-use-3638706/">3</a>).</p>
               <p>(2) Your target is a Unix command line. You might as get a Mac and drop to a UNix command line to closely
               emulate your server. Tharaka Manawardhana, a software engineer, asks, "Why doesn't Adobe provide Creative Suite
               software for Linux? Almost all the commercial software vendors provide a reliable Mac version."
               (<a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/apple/why-programmers-think-mac-os-x-is-best-os-use-3638706/">4</a>).</p>
               <p>(3) The quality of Apple machines plays a part into why programmers think Mac OS X is the best operating system to use.
               In order to construct effictively software for any Apple product, you need a Mac, and their build quality is pretty good. 
               Macs require less maintenece and are able to last a general 5 years before feeling like you need an upgrade
               (<a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8051814">5</a>).</p>
               <p>(4) If you get a Mac, you can quickly run all the main operating systems. It's difficult to run OS X on a Windows or Linux PC
               since you need to find and install hacked versions of OS X. As opposed to a Mac, you can easily install Windows or Linux using a
               virtual environment or Bootcamping half of your hard drive for another OS. If you ever want to develop iOS or OS X software, you need
               to own a Mac. If you want to test websites in Safari for Mac, you need a Mac. If you have a Mac, you can create and test software for
               Windows and Linux from inside it.</p>
